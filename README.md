A short Java project for parallel programming course at University of Warsaw, fall semester 2017-18  

Unfortunately, there was a requirement to write comments and public interface function names in Polish, and I did not have a time to translate them.  
The task was to write a special process-synchronizing class that, and demonstrate it using 2 use cases, I added some basic tests as well just to make sure it works correctly.  
Full description (in Polish) is available here: https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~janowska/PW-LAB/Zadania/Zadanie1/zadanie1.html
